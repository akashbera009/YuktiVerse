## Demo / Landing page

The landing page presents the **Yutivars universe** and the four feature "verses" as modules of the ecosystem. Each route is protected (JWT) and the app emphasizes the AI-first product vision.

> *Screenshots and GIFs go well here ‚Äî include landing, notebook, resume-analyzer, pdf summarizer, and code-editor views.*

## Key features

### 1. Notebook / Academic Organizer (Notebook Verse)

* **Hierarchical file organizer (Keeper)**: organize files by `Year ‚Üí Subject ‚Üí Chapter`.
* Supports three file types:

  * **AI Notebook** ‚Äî freeform text boxes on a notebook-paper-like background. Each textbox can request AI responses (short help, expand to full explanation, chat on topic).
  * **PDF documents** ‚Äî upload and reference PDFs.
  * **Images** ‚Äî upload scanned notes or images.
* File operations: set importance, rename, delete, share/unshare (revoke link), file searching, recent/important/shared tabs.
* **Sharing**: generate public share links; revoke at any time; track views per shared item.
* **Local caching**: files and state cached in `localStorage` to speed searches and reduce API calls.

### 2. Resume Verse

* Upload a resume (PDF/DOCX/TXT) and get an AI-powered critique:

  * Strengths, weaknesses, missing keywords, formatting tips, role-fit suggestions.
* Save analyzed resumes to DB and view a versioned history.
* Export/share analysis reports.

### 3. PDF Verse (PDF Summarizer + MCQ Generator)

* Upload PDFs and receive **topic-wise summaries**: the PDF is split by topics/sections and each gets a concise summary.
* **MCQ generation** from topic summaries.
* **Quiz/Test mode**: take tests based on generated MCQs to estimate retention.
* Save summarized PDFs, MCQs, and test history to DB.

### 4. Code Verse (for developers & learners)

* Create & store code files across languages (JavaScript, C, C++, Java, HTML, etc.) with standard file operations and importance flags.
* Lightweight code editor with five AI capabilities (detailed below).
* **History & versioning**: Every AI action (debug/optimize/etc.) is recorded with a description + AI response; users can modify and save.
* **AI-generated coding contests**: generate problems by topic (arrays, strings, trees, maps, etc.), difficulty level, and language preference; solution verification is automatically assisted by the AI.

---

## Code Editor ‚Äî five core AI capabilities (organized & explained)

1. **Code Generation**

   * Generate starter code from a problem description or prompt in the selected language. Useful for scaffolding functions, templates, or complete solutions.

2. **Debug**

   * Provide targeted debugging help: highlight likely errors, explain cause, and suggest or produce fixes. The editor can run through the failure points returned by the AI.

3. **Optimize**

   * Suggest or produce performance or memory improvements (complexity reductions, better algorithms, or idiomatic language patterns).

4. **Explain**

   * Produce human-friendly explanations of code blocks, algorithm rationale, and step-by-step analysis to aid learning or code review.

5. **Improve (Refactor)**

   * Refactor for readability, maintainability, or modern style (naming, modularization), and optionally apply recommended changes to the stored version.

Each action is stored as an item in the file‚Äôs **history**, labeled (e.g., `debug`, `optimize`, `explain`, etc.) and can be re-applied, revised, or reverted.

---

## Architecture & Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: React , client-side state caching, theme support . Deployed on **Vercel**.
* **Backend**: Node.js + Express, controllers structured & reused for maintainability. Deployed on **Render**.
* **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose Atlas).
* **Authentication**: JWT for route protection; bcrypt for password hashing.
* **AI integration**: Gemini API used for summarization, resume analysis, code assistance, and MCQ generation.
* **File storage**: Cloudinary for images and files.
* **Other services**: Multer for file handling , environment variables to hold secrets, CORS configured.
* **Caching**: `localStorage` + React state caching to reduce API calls.

---

## Schemas & Data modeling (high-level)

Main Mongoose schemas/models included:

* `YearSchema`
* `SubjectSchema` (references Year)
* `ChapterSchema` (references Subject)
* `NotebookSchema` (references User, Chapter)
* `PDFDocumentSchema` / `PdfFileSchema`
* `ResumeSchema`
* `MCQSchema`
* `SharedNotebookSchema`

**Design notes**

* Referential documents are used to reduce query load and duplication ‚Äî e.g., `Subject` references `Year`, `Notebook` references `User` and `Chapter`. This minimizes data duplication and lets queries fetch just the necessary objects.
* Controllers are shared and refactored to avoid code repetition and reduce backend complexity.

---

## Security & Auth

* **Passwords** hashed with **bcrypt** before storage.
* **JWT** used for authentication and protecting routes (access tokens; refresh token pattern optional).
* Secrets, API keys, DB URIs are stored in **environment variables** (never commit `.env` to repo).
* **CORS** implemented to allow safe cross-origin requests between frontend (Vercel) and backend (Render).
* Role-based access and share link revocation enforced server-side for shared content.

---

## Performance & Optimization

* **Referential data modeling** reduces data duplication and query complexity.
* **Local caching**: `localStorage` + React state caching for files and recent responses to reduce repeated network requests and speed up search.
* **Controller reuse** & modular controllers in the backend to minimize code and duplicated DB queries.
* **Reduced API traffic**: store AI responses and only re-request when needed; batch smaller requests where appropriate.

## Running locally

1. **Clone**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/yutivars.git
cd yutivars
```

2. **Install**

```bash
# in project root or separate frontend/backend folders depending on repo layout
cd backend
npm install

cd ../frontend
npm install
```

3. **Environment**
   Create `.env` files for frontend and backend using the example below.

4. **Run**

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm run dev   # (or `node index.js` / `nodemon`)

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm start
```

5. Open the front-end at `http://localhost:3000` (or port configured).

---

## Environment variables (example)

Place these in `backend/.env` (and analogous frontend variables in `frontend/.env`):

```
# Backend
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/yutivars?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS=10
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_or_llm_api_key
CLOUDINARY_URL=cloudinary://api_key:api_secret@cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=...
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-url.vercel.app
```

**Important**: keep `.env` out of version control.

---

## Deployment

* **Frontend**: deployed to **Vercel** ‚Äî static React build with environment variables provided in the Vercel dashboard.
* **Backend**: deployed to **Render** (or Heroku/another server) ‚Äî use environment variables for DB connection and API keys.
* Configure CORS to allow the frontend domain.
* Use HTTPS and production JWT secret rotation.

---

## API / Routes (high-level)

* `POST /api/auth/register` ‚Äî register (bcrypt + store)
* `POST /api/auth/login` ‚Äî login (returns JWT)
* `GET /api/user` ‚Äî protected profile
* `CRUD /api/years`, `/api/subjects`, `/api/chapters` ‚Äî hierarchical organizer
* `CRUD /api/notebooks` ‚Äî notebook items; AI interactions per textbox
* `POST /api/upload` ‚Äî file upload (Cloudinary)
* `POST /api/pdf/summarize` ‚Äî PDF summarization & topic split
* `POST /api/pdf/mcq` ‚Äî generate MCQs
* `POST /api/resume/analyze` ‚Äî resume analyzer
* `CRUD /api/codefiles` ‚Äî store code files & history
* `POST /api/code/ai` ‚Äî endpoints for generation/debug/optimize/explain/improve and contest generation
* `POST /api/share` ‚Äî create/ revoke share links; track views

(Adjust endpoints for your implementation; include validation & rate-limiting in production.)

---

## Known limitations

* The UI is **not optimized for mobile** ‚Äî desktop-first design.
* Some AI features are rate-limited by upstream LLM provider usage / costs.
* File storage relies on Cloudinary ‚Äî setup required.
